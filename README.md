# My Personal Project

## The UBC Weekly Calendar

This application will allow the user to upload their list of courses provided by Workday, and will auto-generate a weekly calendar, showing class times for each day, as well as a map that visualises where each class is. It is also able to detect classes that may be too close together in time, and give a warning. The user can also add extracurriculars, and the calendar will display this too.  

Any UBC student who wants a fast and easy to use calendar for their classes each day can use this program. 

This project is of interest to me as I have found that using Workday to find classes each day is extremely painful, and I was making a calendar for my first year manually. This way, I can automate the process for the rest of my time here. It also does not require internet except for the initial download from Workday, which will be helpful if I do not have connection as I walk across campus.

# My Personal Project

## The UBC Calendar

This application will allow the user to upload their list of courses provided by Workday, and will auto-generate a calendar, showing class times for each day, as well as a map that visualises where each class is. It is also able to detect classes that may be too close together in time, and give a warning. The user can also add additional things they have to do each day (such as a Gym time, working with group time, etc.), and the calendar will display this too.

Any UBC student who wants a fast and easy to use calendar for their classes each day can use this program. 

This project is of interest to me as I have found that using Workday to find classes each day is extremely painful, and I was making a calendar for my first year manually. This way, I can automate the process for the rest of my time here. It also does not require internet except for the initial download from Workday, which will be helpful if I do not have connection as I walk across campus.

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to see exactly what classes I have each day.
- As a user, I want to see where I have to go each day.
- As a user, I want to be able to add extracurrculars that I have to do on top of my class schedule, and specify the time and location.
- As a user, I want to be able to see what I have to do each day.
